#This means that if someone creates a new user account, the account gets saved to the database successfully. Even if something goes wrong in the signal handler (like an error while trying to send a welcome email), that error won't rollback the account creation. The account is saved, but the email sending fails separately, without affecting the account creation.

#So, the account is created, but the email doesnâ€™t get sent because of the error.
